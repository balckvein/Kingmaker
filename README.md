**Welcome to "Kingmaker"**

In a world where females have long dominated the realms, you are the Empress of a small island village. Your people live in harmony with nature, but their isolation has made them vulnerable to threats from neighboring islands.

Your culture demands a king, and he must be the strongest, bravest, and most superior male. The king is not just a ruler, but a symbol of power and fertility. His role is to lead your village, protect its people, and ensure its prosperity.

However, your village is all-female, and men are scarce. To address this imbalance, you have developed a brutal barbarian system similar to ancient Sparta. No currency exists in your society; everything belongs to the state and the king. Resources are gathered for the benefit of the entire community, not for individual wealth.

The king's role is not only to lead but also to breed with the highest females in your village. Only heroes can become kings, and they are chosen based on their strength, bravery, and genetic superiority. The king must be able to adapt to the female culture and recognize the importance of balance between male and female energies.

But beware: neighboring islands are home to savage males who pillage and plunder, taking your females as slaves. These villages are known as "Warrior Clans." They do not care about maintaining a balanced gender ratio in their own society; their sole focus is on conquest and domination.

Your goal is to defeat the male boss of the Warrior Clan that threatens your village's survival. This will allow you to protect your people, ensure their prosperity, and restore balance to your community.
