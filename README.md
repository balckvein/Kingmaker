# Kingmaker
In a world where females have long dominated the realms, you are the Empress of a small island village. Your people live in harmony with nature, but their isolation has made them vulnerable to threats from neighboring islands.  Your culture demands a king, and he must be the strongest, bravest, and most superior male.
